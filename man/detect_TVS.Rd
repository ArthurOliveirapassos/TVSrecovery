\title{Detect TVSs (Telomeric Variant Sequences) in FASTA sequences}
\usage{
detect_TVS(arquivo_fasta, repeticao_canon, min_var_len = 2, max_var_len = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{arquivo_fasta}{Path to the FASTA file containing the sequences.}

\item{repeticao_canon}{Canonical repeat sequence (e.g., `"TTAGGG"`).}

\item{min_var_len}{Minimum allowed size for a TVS (default: 2).}

\item{max_var_len}{Maximum allowed size for a TVS (default: 8).}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` containing canonical repeats and variants, with columns:
\describe{
  \item{seqnames}{Name of the sequence where the repeat/TVS was found}
  \item{start}{Start position}
  \item{end}{End position}
  \item{width}{Length of the repeat/variant}
  \item{type}{Type: `"Canonical"` or `"Variant"`}
  \item{seq_match}{Matched sequence}
  \item{variant}{TRUE for variants, FALSE for canonical repeats}
}
If no repeats or TVSs are found, returns `NULL`.
}
\description{
The `detect_TVS()` function identifies canonical telomeric repeats and
sequence variations occurring between consecutive repeats in FASTA files.
It automatically processes both the forward strand and the reverse-complement
strand, ensuring that all potential telomeric regions are evaluated.
}
\details{
The algorithm operates in three main steps:
1. Identifies all **canonical** occurrences of the provided telomeric repeat.
2. For each pair of consecutive repeats, extracts the intermediate sequence.
3. If this sequence has between `min_var_len` and `max_var_len` bases
   and is not identical to the canonical repeat, it is recorded as a TVS (variant).

The output combines both canonical repeats and variants, enabling further
visualization through `plot_TVS()`.
